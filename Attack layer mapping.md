## Attack Mapping by Layer

### Layer 3 – Network
- ICMP abuse
- Ping sweeps
- Network discovery

### Layer 4 – Transport
- Port scanning (Nmap)
- Brute force (SSH, RDP)
- 
### Layer 7 – Application
- Phishing emails
- Drive-by downloads
- Malicious URLs

## Why Mapping Matters
SOC analysts use layer mapping to:
- Decide which logs to check first
- Reduce investigation time
- Escalate incidents accurately
